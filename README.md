<p><b>Summary of Insights</b></p>


<ul><li>The most frequently used features were the steps tracking feature and the sleep tracking feature.</li>
<li>Typically early mornings from 12 am - 6 am and late nights from 8 pm - 11 pm are our low points with the least amount of activity.</li>
<li>Our more active times are usually from 10 am - 7 pm with activity peaking at around 10 am, 12 pm, or 2 pm.</li>
<li>The features used the least were the weight tracking and heart rate features.</li></ul>
<p><b>Recommendations & Next Steps</b></p>

<ul><li>Investigate more into our specific consumer's lifestyle and ages. This will give us a better sense of direction as to who and where to market our ads.</li></ul>
<li>Features such as step tracking, heart rate, and weight should be marketed more toward our more active users. These features would be good for people in fitness, outdoor sports, hiking, etc.</li></ul>
<li>The app should add features such as goals and highlights to help keep our customers motivated on their fitness or weight loss journeys.</li></ul>
<li>The Leaf bracelet tracker should also have different color bands to allow for more customization and choice for the consumer. This can be sold at a relatively low cost, $5 - $10 for rubber bands and $20 - $30 for stainless steel or mesh bands.</li></ul>
